## FAQ

Q: I have carefully test the code in my local system (all testing passed) but still failed in online ci?
 
A: There are two possible reasons: 
1. the online ci system is different from your local system;
2. there are some network error causing the downloading test failed, which you can find in the ci log.

For the second reason, all you need to do is to retry the test.
